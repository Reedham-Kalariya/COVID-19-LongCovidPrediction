# COVID-19-LongCovidPrediction
LongCOVID is a collective term used to classify diseases that are generally chronic and were first diagnosed or there effects were enhanced due to diagnosis
of COVID in a patient/person (diagnosis was defined as positive test).

The code here was used by me as a script to evaluate the chances of an individual developing COVID based on their demographics. It is written in R and uses
data from MDClone as .csv files. Using the acquired data, the project conducts logistic regression, Chi-Square association between factors and diagnoses date
of long-COVID, and other statistical analysis on the data. Graphs are also generated to verify if the results are significant enough. Eventually enough 
information for different demographic factors and to make a probability of developing long-COVID diseases can be formed with each of the data generated. 

Although R script is done and eventual outcome was the table, I hope to translate the code into Python sometime where I can utilize libraries like Numpy, 
Pandas, and Scikit-Learn to make it autogenerate the table intended.
Please view the R code in the branch named Reedham-Rcode-1
